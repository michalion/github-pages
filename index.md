Hi there, I'm Michał, solution architect from Poland. I hope you'll find the information on my website helpful. I aim to make this place a one-stop shop for solution architecture foundations and more!

I found it quite challenging to find a decent information on `Architectural Characteristics` / `Quality Attributes`, the tactics available, how to measure them, track their evolution along the system itself.
