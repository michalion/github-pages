# Maintainability
The maintainability definition is somewhat blurry.

TBA:
- definition
- what may be business needs that maintainability addresses?
- ways of measuring maintainability
- ways of improving maintainability
-- linting & formatting
-- static code analysis
-- modularity
-- coefficients
-- testing / TDD / coverage
- examples of architecturally significant requirements
- developer feedback loop (super important)
- release cycle
- relation to testability
- Other QAs impact on maintainability
